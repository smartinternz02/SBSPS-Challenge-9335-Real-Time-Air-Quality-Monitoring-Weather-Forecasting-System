Weather forecasting is the prediction of the state of the atmosphere for a given location using the application of science and technology.
This includes temperature, rain, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.
Weather warnings are a special kind of short-range forecast carried out for the protection of human life.
Weather warnings are issued by the governments throughout the world for all kinds of threatening weather events including tropical storms and tropical cyclones depending upon the location.
The forecast may be short-range or Long-range. It is a very interesting and challenging task.
This report provides a basic understanding of the purpose and scope of weather forecasts, the basic principles and the general models developed for forecasting.

1.0 Introduction:
Weather forecasting means the prediction of the weather through the application of the principles of physics, supplemented by a variety of statistical and empirical techniques.
In addition to predictions of atmospheric phenomena themselves, weather forecasting includes predictions of changes on the Earth's surface climate.
These changes are caused by atmospheric conditions like snow and ice cover, storm tides, and floods.
The basis for weather prediction started with the theories of the ancient Greek philosophers and continued with Renaissance scientists.
It was followed by the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries.
The theoretical models of 20th-and 21st-century atmospheric scientists and meteorologists helped for the betterment in applications.
The so-called synoptic weather map came to be the principal tool of 19th-century meteorologists.
This is used today in weather stations and on television weather reports all over the world.
All can happen only through a comprehensive weather forecast.
Any weather prediction needs a systematic collection of weather record of various places and proper analysis using the data for prediction.

2.0 Practical applications of weather forecasting: 
Systematic weather records were kept after the invention of the instruments for measuring atmospheric conditions during the 17th century. 
Undoubtedly, these early records were employed mainly by those engaged in agriculture. 
Planting and harvesting can be planned better and carried out more efficiently if all the long-term weather patterns are estimated in advance. 
Weather warnings are a special kind of short-range forecasts.
It is needed for the protection of human life from weather extremes. 
Weather warnings are issued by government and military organizations throughout the world for all kinds of threatening weather events like tropical storms which are called as hurricanes, typhoons, or tropical cyclones, depending on location. 
Weather forecasting became an important tool for aviation during the 1920s and '30s.
Many oceangoing shipping vessels as well as military ships use optimum ship routing forecasts to plan their routes in order to minimize the loss of time, potential damage, and fuel consumption in heavy seas.
Any observer who has learned the nature's signs in the sky can interpret the appearance of the sky, the wind, and other local effects and " foretell the weather. "
